    "# Speech-to-Text Pipeline Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on implementing a practical application that integrates speech-to-text, summarization, and translation functionalities. The goal is to create a working solution that effectively processes spoken language from audio files, provides a concise summary, and translates the summarized text into the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline consists of three main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Speech-to-Text (WHISPER)**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Converts audio files into written text using the WHISPER model, known for its high accuracy in speech recognition.\n",
    "   - **Input:** Audio file (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`)\n",
    "   - **Output:** Transcribed text\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Process:**\n",
    "   - The audio file is processed by the WHISPER model.\n",
    "   - The model outputs a text representation of the spoken content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summarization (BART)**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Generates a concise summary of the transcribed text using the BART model summarization techniques.\n",
    "   - **Input:** Transcribed text\n",
    "   - **Output:** Summarized text\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Process:**\n",
    "   - The transcribed text is fed into the summarization model.\n",
    "   - The model generates a summary that captures the key points and essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Translation**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Translates the summarized text into the target language using a translation model.\n",
    "   - **Input:** Summarized text\n",
    "   - **Output:** Translated text\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Process:**\n",
    "   - The summarized text is translated into the desired language.\n",
    "   - The final translated text is produced for further use.\n",
    "\n",
